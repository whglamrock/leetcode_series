class Solution:
    # @param {int[]} nums an array with positive and negative numbers
    # @param {int} k an integer
    # @return {double} the maximum average
    def maxAverage(self, nums, k):

        l, r = 2147483647, -2147483648

        diff = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        diff[0] = 0

        while r - l > 10 ** -6:

            # the mid is the candidate of ideal average
            mid = (l + r) / 2.0

            check = False

            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                # the diff[i] is the accumulated difference:
                #   (sum of m elements - m * mid), which is invalid when i < k;
                diff[i] = diff[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - mid
                if i >= k and diff[i] - min_pre >= 0:

                    min_pre = min(min_pre, diff[i - k + 1])

            # notice the exit condition, and we need to calculate average
            #   we cannot set new boundary +1 or -1, or we could miss
            #   the answer

        return l    # we can return r too, cuz we need to return a double type
